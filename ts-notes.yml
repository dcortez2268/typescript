typescript:
    js + static type system
    allows us to prevent unwanted behavior at runtime

type system:
    helps us catch errors during development
    uses type annotations to analyze our code
    only active during development
    doesn't provide any performance optimization

execution flow:
    typescript code (js + type annotations) => typescript compiler => js code

advantages:
    adds types, next-gen js features, non js features like interfaces or generics, meta programming features like decorators, rich configuraiton options, modern tooling that helps even in non typescript projects
    checks types and for other errors during compile time vs js having to check at runtime

INSTALLS:
  npm i -g typescript ts-node: typescript library, ts-node is cli tool, call with tsc command

PRIMITIVE TYPES: 
  core primitive types in typescript are all lowercase!
  types are inferred when declaring variables, although you can explicitly set the type, it is better practice to let ts infer the types
 
  number: no differentiation between integers or floats
  string:
  boolean: true, false, no truthy or falsy values
  object: any js object, more specific types of object are possible
  array:
  tuple: added by typescript, fixed length and fixed type array, need to explicitly define when used in object
  enum: added by ts, automatically enumerated global constant identifiers
  any: any kind of value, no specific type assignment, just like js, avoid using
 
NON-PRIMITIVE TYPES: 
  Union: allows ts to accept more than one type for a variable, also you can point the reference variable to point to other applicable types even after it has been assigned
  literal: defines exact value a variable should hold, often combined with unions to provide a set of accepted values
  aliases/ custom types: allows you to create a type variable for types you repeatedly define, can implement objects as well
  function return types: return type of variable or void if does not return a value
  function type: allows you to define function type, as well as function signature
